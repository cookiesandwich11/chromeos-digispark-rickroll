# chromeos-digispark-rickroll
A rickroll for a digispark badusb. I tried to replicate the "you are an idiot" virus but with Rick Astley.

This prank consists of 2 parts; the badusb and the website.
The badusb firt enables popups and then goes to the website.
The website just creates a bunch (15) of windows that just have never gonna give you up playing.

If you want to use the link without a badusb, just go to https://cookiesandwich11.github.io/chromeos-digispark-rickroll/ and enable pop-ups.
